## Trading Scanner Overview

**Project Description:**
The trading scanner is a sophisticated tool designed for identifying trading opportunities in cryptocurrency markets, specifically focusing on BUSD pairs. The scanner operates based on predefined times, primarily the opening of 4-hour candles (7 times in 24 hours), with options to adjust to 1-hour and 5-minute candles under specific market conditions. The strategy involves:

1. **Market Phase Identification:** Detecting when the market is in a distribution phase.
2. **Consolidation Detection:** Identifying consolidation patterns where the price is at the bottom half of the consolidation range.
3. **Pattern Recognition:** Looking for sequences of 4 consecutive green or red candles on hourly, 30-minute, and 5-minute charts to gauge market sentiment.

**Additional Features:**
- **FOMO Strategy Integration:** Utilizes market FOMO to identify potential trading opportunities where the majority of traders are likely to open their positions.
- **Volatility Measurement:** Measures market volatility and provides several metrics, including spread sum for specific time periods and anomaly detection. The use of color-coding for spread sums helps predict price movements (e.g., 5 green spreads suggest a higher probability of price increase).
- **Custom Charts:** Displays how the market behaves in the first 3 candles of each hour and each 30-minute interval for the past 1000 minutes. Also compares BTC prices with the coin of interest, including spread, number of trades, and volume, to identify anomalies and understand the coin's movement relative to BTC.

**Performance Insights:**
- Initially, the scanner achieved a 15x balance increase before Binance delisted BUSD. Pairs with other stablecoins like USDT did not offer the same level of accuracy, potentially due to market manipulation or differences in resolution.
- Includes a scoring system to evaluate potential trades:
  \[
  \text{Score} = \text{Number}\left( \text{globalArray}[x].\text{sumAllSpread} + \frac{|\text{globalArray}[x].\text{sumAllGreen} - \text{globalArray}[x].\text{sumAllRed}|}{5} + \text{globalArray}[x].\text{cardCount} \times 5 + \text{globalArray}[x].\text{topAllRed} + \text{globalArray}[x].\text{topAllGreen} \right)
  \]
  where a higher score indicates a higher probability of profitable trades.

**Key Insight:**
The scanner's effectiveness is highly dependent on the trader's experience. While the tool provides advanced metrics and insights, optimal results are achieved with skilled traders who can interpret and act on the data effectively.
